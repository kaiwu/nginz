## Nginz

nginz is a `nginx` module writer, which allows one to write nginx modules in `zig`. so far it 
is based on official nginx release 1.27.4 and zig 0.13. nginz is tested with linux only.

A typical workflow is following: 

```
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
$ zig build
$ zig build test
```

One might need to first address the system library dependencies, a requirement for nginx development.
specifically they are.
  
  * -lz
  * -lcrypt
  * -lcrypto
  * -lpcre
  * -lssl
  * -lgd

> [!NOTE]
> The SSL zig bindings are generated with `OpenSSL 3`.

> [!CAUTION]
> Many nginx structs have variable sizes, as they depend on the opt-in features at compile time.
> Options such as `--with-compat`, `--with-http_ssl_module` could drastically affect many structs.
> To ensure binary compatibility, one needs to adjust the zig bindings accordingly. The project
> defaults to the configure options showed below in `main` branch. The `docker` branch configures
> as many features as the official nginx [docker][3] debian release. Note the structs differences
> in the test asserts.

To ease the development. A `nginz` binary is built as an artifact along with the module objects.
It is a nginx wrapper, and by default built with

`./auto/configure --with-http_ssl_module --with-debug` 

nginz also has built-in `ngx_http_js_module` with quickjs engine, excluding all the `xml/xslt` related features.

A module `echoz` is provided as an example, it is a tribute to @[agentzh][2] and his [echo][1] module. `echoz`
so far is a simplified version of `echo` and it misses some of the directives.

By all means, deploy the module objects with your own binary building toolchains.
